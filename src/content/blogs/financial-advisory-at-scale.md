> What if people had a financial advisor in their pocket?

_Would debt instantly go away? Would people still make poor financial decisions? And would they finally understand where their money is going?_

I've seen firsthand what poor financial decisions can do to people's livelihoods. For many reasons people struggle with financial stability, whether it's not having enough income, dealing with economic uncertainty, or simply carrying the weight of trying to survive. It's impossible to think about investments when your basic needs aren't being met. But for those who do have a baseline level of income and some room to grow it, a major barrier remains: _financial literacy_.

In my own life, I've often been the person family and friends turn to for financial advice, the one helping them make sense of budgets, debt and goals. Through these conversations, I've realized how rare it is to find personalized, trustworthy financial guidance that's both affordable and consistent. That gap, between people's willingness to learn and their access to good advice is what sparked my mission.

## What happens when machines start giving financial advice instead?

Financial advisors and planners are specialists whose services are typically only accessible to the wealthy. Managing finances properly takes time: balancing books, reviewing estates, and planning your retirement investments aren't quick tasks. These professionals are often buried in spreadsheets, analyzing data so they can give clients a moment-by-moment view of where their money is, where it's going, and where it should be.

But today, we have the tools to transform how this work gets done, and who gets access to it. Technology can vastly streamline these processes, allowing advisors to manage more clients, spend more time on strategy, and less time on manual analysis. For the everyday person, this means finally being able to access personalized financial guidance without the prohibitive costs or waiting periods that once made it out of reach.

The people I've chosen to focus on are those caught in the middle: the working professionals, small business owners, and families who want to make smart financial decisions but don't have the time, expertise, or access to trusted guidance. Their "job to be done" is simple, to make sense of their money and move toward financial confidence. My goal is to bridge that gap: to empower advisors with tools that amplify their capacity, and to give everyday people the ability to receive both human and AI-driven guidance that's empathetic, personalized, and available at scale.

## What are people currently using, and where is the chaos?

Today, people "solve" their lack of financial advice in a few predictable ways:

1. **Traditional human advisors** remain the gold standard for trust and personalization, but their services are often expensive, relationship-driven, and inherently limited in scale. Many still rely on Excel sheets, macros, and outdated CRMs to manage clients — the same systems that leave little time for the empathy and strategy that define great advice.

2. **Robo-advisors** offer a scalable alternative. They use algorithms and, increasingly, Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate financial insights into plain language and automate decisions. Yet, while they improve accessibility, they often lack human context, fiduciary care that build lasting trust.

3. **Hybrid firms** attempt to bridge the gap, combining human expertise with automation. They provide higher levels of personalization but remain constrained by human bandwidth, compliance burdens, and the slow evolution of legacy infrastructure.

Many still believe that "scale and trust can't coexist", that automation will always erode empathy — but this belief is exactly what needs to be challenged. The future of financial advisory lies in harmonizing human judgment and technological intelligence, creating a system where trust and scale reinforce one another rather than compete.

## What will the future of financial advisory look like by 2027?

Attempts at forecasting the future have existed for centuries — from ancient prophecies to modern white papers. In today's world, our projections about Artificial Intelligence often converge on one theme: _Acceleration._ The AI 2027 report, which explores the emergence of "Superhuman AI," predicts dramatic gains in productivity across knowledge-based industries.

By 2027, adjacent fields like financial advisory will experience unprecedented efficiency leaps. Tasks that once consumed hours: drafting reports, reconciling data, translating numbers into insight, will take minutes. These tools won't replace advisors; they'll amplify their wisdom and emotional intelligence through thoughtful design.

Most people believe that AI will automate advice. I believe it will elevate it. The real opportunity lies not in replacing human empathy, but in scaling it — teaching AI to embody fiduciary ethics, emotional regulation, and personalized tone while extending an advisor's reach.

**The future of advisory is not man or machine, but man through machine.**

## What 3 insights and key takeaways are visible today?

### Cultural Insight

Culturally, people crave tone-matched reassurance. Andrew Lo, a professor of finance at MIT Sloan, has shown that generative AI can provide personalized financial advice tailored to each individual. His research suggests that emotional calibration, remaining neutral when a client is exuberant and positive when a client is fearful, helps stabilize investor behavior. In many ways, financial advisors are as much therapists as they are analysts.

### Market Insight

Data shows that advisors spend roughly 40% of their time on non-client activities. Given that the U.S. advisory industry manages trillions of dollars, this translates into billions in avoidable cost. As much as $100 billion may be locked inside inefficiencies such as fragmented advice delivery, lost client engagement, slow onboarding, churn, compliance friction, and administrative waste. At the same time, trust remains expensive and the cost of bad advice can be catastrophic, measured in financial losses, lawsuits, and broken relationships.

### Technical Insight

Large Language Models (LLMs) already pass portions of the CFA exam and demonstrate above-average human performance in advanced numerical reasoning. With the introduction of domain-specific modules, tool-use, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, these systems can begin reasoning ethically using case law and fiduciary precedent. Yet they remain bottlenecked by bias and emotional-regulation challenges. In essence, "teaching machines fiduciary duty" is both a moral and an engineering problem.

## What can be done in the next 8 weeks?

As the lack of accessible financial guidance and literacy continues to grow, for me and for many others — I want to prove that personalized advice isn't a luxury; it's a necessity. Over the next eight weeks, I'll put this belief to the test by speaking directly with financial advisors across Canada and the United States.

I'll begin with small independent firms to understand how they balance empathy, regulation, and capacity. From there, I'll expand to executives at larger wealth-management organizations to see how scale and structure shape the delivery of advice. Through these conversations, I aim to uncover patterns: how advice is currently given, what limits it, and how technology can preserve trust while multiplying reach.

Success, to me, means transforming this personal curiosity into a professional framework, a future foundation for building **Munk**. The ultimate goal is to design and validate a system that helps advisors manage more clients with less friction, while giving everyday people access to real, human-guided financial wisdom at scale. When designed ethically, technology doesn't replace the human advisor — it helps them serve with empathy, precision, and purpose.

## Who am I?

I'm Emmanuel Sogelola, a Cansbridge Scholar by night and a Security Engineer by day. I'm fascinated by the intersection of AI and financial intelligence, and I'm on a mission to reimagine how financial advice can be delivered at scale.

I believe that financial advice has always been personal. The question isn't whether AI can advise — it's whether it can care.

I care because I've seen both sides: the human fear of money and the engineer's pursuit of precision. Follow my journey as I test whether machines can earn fiduciary trust.
